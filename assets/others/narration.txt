Welcome to Getting Over Java. As the name suggests, this game was made using Java! More specifically, the LWJGL and JBox2D libraries. This game should summarise my experience making this game. Java is heavily abstracted, forbiding you from accessing any lower level implmentations of code. It is like riding a bicycle with training wheels, except that pedalling forward might occasionally cause you to go backwards instead. And you cannot even do anything about it because the JVM's garbage collector can quite literally be garbage itself.
